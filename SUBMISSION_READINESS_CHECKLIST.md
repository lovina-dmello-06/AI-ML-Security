Line 1643: DOI: 10.1145/3462757.3466081 (GDPR ML Compliance)
Line 1655: arXiv:2008.04113 (Data Minimization)
Line 1550: JAMIA 2011, Vol 18, pp 498-505 (EHR Access)
```

**Action:** Look up these papers online and add real authors

### 2. Run Plagiarism Check ⚠️ IMPORTANT
**Status:** Not yet done  
**Time Needed:** 30-60 minutes  
**Cost:** $3-10  

**Recommended Tool:**
